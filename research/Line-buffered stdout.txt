The stream stderr is unbuffered. The stream stdout is line-buffered when it points to a terminal.
Partial lines will not appear until fflush(3) or exit(3) is called, or a newline is printed.
This can produce unexpected results, especially with debugging output.
The buffering mode of the standard streams (or any other stream) can be changed using the setbuf(3) or setvbuf(3) call.
Note that in case stdin is associated with a terminal, there may also be input buffering in the terminal driver, entirely unrelated
to stdio buffering. (Indeed, normally terminal input is line buffered in the kernel.)
This kernel input handling can be modified using calls like tcsetattr(3); see also stty(1), and termios(3).
